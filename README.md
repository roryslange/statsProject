# statsProject
This project was completed for my statistics for engineers class at wayne state university as the final project for the winter 2023 semester. We used predictive analytics to determine what makes up a popular song by analyzing different metrics from the Spotify api.

Some parts of this project did not work as intended. We expected a more linear trend line between genres and popularity, however, as tastes change between cultures and geographic locations the data we chose to use ended up being messy and not very informative. The math is all correct, there is just no visible or predictable trend line across the data. Which we listed in our project presentation.
